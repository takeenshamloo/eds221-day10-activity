## Day 10: Activity

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

### Load in data

```{r}
meteorological_data <- read_csv(here("data", "ntl20_v6.csv")) |>
  clean_names()

ice_duration_data <- read_csv(here("data", "ntl33_v7.csv"), na = c("-999", "")) |>
  clean_names()
```

### Plot Ice Duration across different Lakes

```{r}
lake_mean_duration <- ice_duration_data |> 
  group_by(lakeid) |> 
  summarise(mean_duration = mean(ice_duration, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(ice_duration_data, aes(x = lakeid, y = ice_duration, color = lakeid)) +
  labs(y = "Ice Duration") +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_hline(data = lake_mean_duration, aes(yintercept = mean_duration), 
             color = c("red", "green", "blue"), size = 1)
```

### Plot mean ice duration in each lake area by year

```{r}
yearly_mean_ice_duration <- ice_duration_data |> 
  group_by(year4, lakeid) |> 
  summarise(mean_duration = mean(ice_duration, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  filter(!is.nan(mean_duration))

ggplot(ice_duration_data, aes(x = year4, y = ice_duration, color = lakeid)) +
  geom_line(data = yearly_mean_ice_duration, aes(x = year4, y = mean_duration), 
            color = "pink", size = 1) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(y = "Ice Duration", title = "Ice Duration and Yearly Means in Madison Lake Area") +
  facet_wrap(~ lakeid) 
```

The ice at the lake denoted by "WI" has the greatest average which is around
10 units above the other two averages. Likewise "MO" and "ME" are very similar 
with lake "MO" slightly exceeding "ME" by a unit or two.

### Plot Mean Air Temp

```{r}
mean_winter_temp_data <- meteorological_data |> 
  filter(month %in% c(1, 2, 12)) |> 
  group_by(year4) |> 
  summarise(mean_winter_temp = mean(ave_air_temp_adjusted, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(mean_winter_temp_data, aes(x = year4, y = mean_winter_temp)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  labs(y = "Mean Winter Temperature (°C)", x = "Year", 
       title = "Mean Winter Temperatures in Madison Lake Area by Year") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
joined_data <- left_join(mean_winter_temp_data, yearly_mean_ice_duration, by = "year4")

ggplot(joined_data, aes(x = mean_winter_temp, y = mean_duration)) +
  geom_point(color = "green", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  labs(y = "Mean Ice Duration (days)", x = "Mean Winter Temperature (°C)",
       title = "Relationship Between Mean Winter Temperature and Ice Duration") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
library(lubridate)

# Subset data since 1970 and calculate ice-off day of the year
thaw_data <- ice_duration_data |> 
  filter(year4 >= 1970) |> 
  mutate(ice_off_day = yday(ice_off))

# Create a plot for the ice-off day from 1970 to present
ggplot(thaw_data, aes(x = year4, y = ice_off_day)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red") +
  labs(y = "Day of the Year (Ice Off)", x = "Year",
       title = "Ice Off Day by Year (1970 - Present)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
